# Rise Nutrition Web App

This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web application for Rise Nutrition.

## Getting Started with Development

1. `yarn install` will install all of the dependencies for the project
2. `yarn dev` will start up a development server with hot reloading. Note that it is not server rendered, so don't be alarmed if the pages take a moment to load.
3. `yarn build` and then `yarn start` will create a production build of the app and will allow you to verify the server-side rendered portions of your application.
